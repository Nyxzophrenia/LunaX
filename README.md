# LunaX

**Work in Progress (WIP)**
C++ Engine Prototype | Student Learning Project

LunaX is an unfinished C++ prototype developed as a learning-focused project to explore engine architecture concepts. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with core systems such as ECS, simulation loops, platform abstraction, and scene management.

This project is **not production-ready** and is expected to change frequently as concepts are tested and refined.

## Who Can Benefit

LunaX is designed to be accessible and flexible. It is suitable for:

Students exploring modern C++ and engine design

Researchers in scientific or disaster simulations

Engineers experimenting with systems or simulation prototypes

Anyone who cannot afford expensive hardware but wants to test, modify, and optimize an engine freely

The project is open for customization, allowing users to adapt and optimize the engine for their specific needs.

## Purpose

Practice modern C++ (C++17+)

Learn engine and system-level architecture

Experiment with an Entity-Component-System (ECS) design

Build a foundation for future simulations or simple games

Provide a free and modifiable engine for learning, research, and experimentation

## Current Status

⚠️ Incomplete and experimental

⚠️ No stable API

⚠️ Features may be missing or non-functional

## Build Information

There is currently no official build system.

Compilation may fail or be incomplete at this stage. A build system (e.g., CMake) is planned for future development.


## Notes

Intended for educational and personal learning purposes

Code structure and design decisions are subject to change

Not intended for production use

Fully open for experimentation—users can modify, optimize, and adapt LunaX to their own research or learning needs

## Planned Features

Proper build system (CMake)

Scripting support

Test suite for engine modules

Additional example projects and simulations

More advanced rendering and physics support

## Contributing

This project is primarily a personal learning project, but contributions are welcome for:

Bug fixes or stability improvements

Feature experiments

Educational examples and tutorials

Please respect that the API and structure may change frequently.
