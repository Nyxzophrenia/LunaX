# LunaX

 **Work in Progress (WIP)** 
**C++ Engine Prototype | Student Learning Project**

LunaX is an unfinished C++ prototype developed as a **learning-focused project** to explore engine architecture concepts. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with core systems such as ECS, simulation loops, platform abstraction, and scene management.

This project is **not production-ready** and is expected to change frequently as concepts are tested and refined.

## Purpose

* Practice modern C++ (C++17+)
* Learn engine and system-level architecture
* Experiment with an Entity-Component-System (ECS) design
* Build a foundation for future simulations or simple games

## Project Structure

```
LunaX/
├─ engine/
│  ├─ core/        # Core utilities (e.g., time management)
│  ├─ ecs/         # Entity-Component-System implementation
│  ├─ platform/    # Window and input handling
│  ├─ scene/       # Scenarios and scene loading
│  └─ simulation/  # Physics, rules, and simulation logic
├─ projects/       # Planned example projects
├─ scripting/      # Planned scripting support
├─ tests/          # Planned tests
├─ tools/          # Development tools
├─ main.cpp        # Application entry point
├─ TODO.md         # Planned features and tasks
└─ README.md
```

## Current Status

* ⚠️ Incomplete and experimental
* ⚠️ No stable API
* ⚠️ Features may be missing or non-functional

## Build Information

There is currently **no official build system**.

Compilation may fail or be incomplete at this stage. A build system (e.g., CMake) is planned for future development.

Example (not guaranteed to work):

```bash
g++ main.cpp -std=c++17
```

## Notes

* Intended for **educational and personal learning purposes**
* Code structure and design decisions are subject to change
* Not intended for production use
